Prerequisites
-------------

* Has been tested on Ubuntu and OS X. However it should run on most Linux machines (since there are no distribution specific dependency).

* For development server, minimum of 1GB RAM, 1.6GHz 1 CPU core is required for setup (for production sizing requirements see the relevant section in the [Deployment guide](./deployment_guide.md#deployment-considerations "Deployment Guide")).

* Postgres, redis-server should be running

* It helps to install python-dev, libxml2-dev, libxslt1-dev, zlib1g-dev and libffi-dev (for a debian based system, the command would be *sudo apt-get install python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev libffi-dev*)

* uSurvey has been tested on python2.7 and is compatible with django 1.8 and django 1.9 as of this time of writing. 

* Required python libraries are contained in the pip-requires.txt file found within the project directory.


Installation Instructions
-------------------------

* Execute the following commands from your installation directory:

        git clone https://github.com/unicefuganda/uSurvey.git

        cd uSurvey

        git checkout dev
        
        cd mics

        cp travis-settings.py localsettings.py
        (adjust localsettings.py for db and test_db setup)

        cd ../survey

        cp interviewer_configs.py.example interviewer_configs.py

        cd ..

        mkvirtualenv uSurvey

        pip install -U -r pip-requires.txt

        python manage.py syncdb --noinput

        python manage.py makemigrations
        
        python manage.py migrate

        python manage.py createsuperuser
        (to create the initial user access)

        python manage.py load_parameters


Before Using The System
-----------------------
       
###Loading Location Data
      
* Before using the setup, you need to load data for administrative divisions of the required country.

* To load administrative divisions into the system, run the following commands:

        python manage.py import_location [LOCATION_FILE_CSV]

> The first line of the csv file shall be taken as file header. 

> The file header is expected to contain names as per the administrative division in a comma separated format. In addition, there can be an additional header for enumeration area. This header should be named *EAName*. Sample file for Uganda is included in the project directory as administrative_divisions.csv.example.

###Setting Up Map Reporting

To enable uSurvey capture survey data in country map, A few settings needs to be made on the ``mics/settings.py`` file.

uSurvey must be made aware of the shape file to use. The shape file is expected to contain json data. 

Sample data is given below:  
```

Required settings are given below:

- SHAPE_FILE_URI: This is the URI pointing to the shape file of the country. Example configurations are
    
    > SHAPE_FILE_URI = '/static/map_resources/uganda_districts_2011_005.json'
    
    > SHAPE_FILE_URI = 'http://someothershapedata/resources/mycountry.json'

- SHAPE_FILE_LOC_FIELD: This is the primary field used to indicate the corresponding Administrative area whose shape file is presented in shape file list item.
    
- SHAPE_FILE_LOC_ALT_FIELD: This is the secondary field used to indicate the corresponding Administrative area whose shape file is presented in shape file list item. This entry shall be used if **SHAPE_FILE_LOC_FIELD** is missing in any shape data list item


Starting Up
-----------

* **Make sure you configure appropriate ports in the supervisord.conf file.**

* Start the system using supervisor:

        supervisord -c supervisord.conf

> In supervisord.conf, the configuration under [program:odk-server] is required to serve ODK requests, while the configuration under [program:django-interface-server] is for serving other requests.
> Only the ports configured in [program:odk-server] and [program:django-interface-server] are required to handle requests. Other ports configured on supervisord.conf file are for managing supervisor
