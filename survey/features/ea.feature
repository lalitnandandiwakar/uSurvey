Feature: EA upload

    Scenario: Upload EA
        Given I am logged in as researcher
        And I have some locations to add EA
        And I have a survey
        When I visit upload EA page
        Then I should see EA upload form fields
        When I click on the link for input file format
        Then I should see table of EA layout
        When I click on the link for input file format
        Then said EA layout should collapse
        When I have a EA csv file
        And I input that file
        And I select a survey
        And I click the save button
        Then I should see EA upload is in progress
